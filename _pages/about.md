Welcome! I am a (tenure-track) Richard Duke Assistant Professor in the School of Math at Georgia Tech.

In Fall 2025, I am teaching Math 8803, a topics course in on Ramsey and Tur√°n problems for graphs and hypergraphs.

My  research interests are extremal, probabilistic, and algebraic combinatorics, especially Ramsey theory, graph coloring, additive combinatorics, discrete geometry, and coding theory, and their applications to computer science.

Previously, I was an NSF postdoctoral research fellow at Princeton University working with [Noga Alon](https://web.math.princeton.edu/~nalon/). Before that, I received my PhD in mathematics from Stanford University in 2021, where my advisor was [Jacob Fox](https://stanford.edu/~jacobfox/).

You can find my CV [here](https://alkjash.github.io/files/CV_Xiaoyu_He.pdf). I blog about life, research, and rationality at [my personal blog](https://radimentary.wordpress.com); most of my better posts can also be found cross-posted on [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/alkjash).

## Current group
