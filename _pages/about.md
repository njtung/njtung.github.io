I am a PhD student at Stanford University.

My research interests are probabilistic, arithmetic, and extremal combinatorics, especially random thresholds, quasirandomness, and homomorphism inequalities. Some of my favorite tools come from high-dimensional probability and Fourier analysis.

<!-- Some things I want to learn more about are ergodic theory and computational complexity. -->

Previously, I was an undergraduate at Brown University where I also obtained a Master's in mathematics.
