I am a PhD student at Stanford University.

My research interests are probabilistic, arithmetic, and extremal combinatorics, especially random thresholds and regularity methods. Some of my favorite tools are concentration of measure, Fourier analysis, and ergodic theory. I want to learn more about computational complexity.

<!-- Some things I want to learn more about are ergodic theory and computational complexity. -->

Previously, I was an undergraduate at Brown University where I also obtained a Master's in mathematics.

My Erdős number is 2.
