I am a PhD student at Stanford University, advised by [Persi Diaconis](https://diaconis.ckirby.su.domains) and [Jacob Fox](https://stanford.edu/~jacobfox/).

My research interests are extremal, probabilistic, and arithmetic combinatorics, especially random thresholds, Sidorenko-type inequalities, and analytic methods.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at Brown University advised by [Eli Upfal](https://cs.brown.edu/people/eupfal/).

My Erd≈ës number is 2.
