I am a PhD student at Stanford University.

My research interests are extremal, probabilistic, and arithmetic combinatorics, especially random thresholds, Sidorenko-type inequalities, and analytic methods.

Previously, I was an undergraduate at Brown University where I also obtained a Master's in mathematics.

My Erdős number is 2.
